NOTES
when we ran this first with 'npm run start' - that worked because when we created the application with 'create-react-app frontend'
it downloaded the dependenices locally and so running the app directly off our machine with npm worked because it had these

however there is no point having these locally as then there are 2 copies - one on the container - so we deleted the local copies

when we now try and run the app - it works with docker becuase docker installs the dependencies

removing the files will cause issues when you are using volumes
`docker run -p 8080:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app a8524ac19cf7`
the above says - map port 8080 on my machine to 3000 in the container. Then use the node_modules app that is within the docker container (which gets installed from 'npm install' in the dockerfile). For everything else use pwd as a reference

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
